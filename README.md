# More Features mod

Mod that should add a lot of new blocks, items and everything that randomly get into my delusional head :D

Currently, adds:
* Four flower crowns: dandelion, rose, cherry and dead bush. All can be crafted like a helmet with representing plant (check recipe book),

* Bedrock armor (no bedrock obtaining in survival)

* Colored glowstone blocks that can be crafted using 8 of any glowstone block and 1 dye

* Workbench On A Stick. Can be crafted using a stick and a workbench. Right click any block to use workbench anywhere
